### General Information
This is a game I made for my final project in Computer Science 10, GameMaker: Studio 1.4 was used to create it. I used this tool because it is what my teacher recommended to me, and to create the sprites, both MS Paint and GameMaker: Studio's built in sprite editor. My friend made the music for the game.

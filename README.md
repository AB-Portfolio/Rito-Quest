### General Information
This is a game I made for my final project in Computer Science 10, GameMaker: Studio 1.4 was used to create it. I used this tool because it is what my teacher recommended to me, and to create the sprites, both MS Paint and GameMaker: Studio's built in sprite editor. My friend made the music for the game.

### Purpose of the Program
#### Society
Gaming ties into a lot of different technology. There is a diverse use to gaming in society, from something as small as flying drones to something as big as making repairs on the ISS through satellite and virtual reality.
#### Culture
Gaming is becoming a part of everyday culture. Over 1.2  billion people play video games, including around 50% of of youth and young adults.
#### Economy
Gaming can be used to train employees before they are hired for a job. This technique is already being used in many professions including: bartending, surgeons, electronic repairs, operators of large machinery, astronauts, and many other professions.
### Abstractions and Algorithms
GameMaker: Studios has a lot of built in features to help create the algorithms and abstractions in this game. When you move through a door in the game, you aren't actually going into a new room, GameMaker just places objects and occasionally changes the background and moves your character to new coordinates so you have the perception of going through a new room, when in reality, you aren't. The same sort of thing happens with almost everything in the game, you have the perception of your character moving when you press W A S or D, but nothing actually moves.
